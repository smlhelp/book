One of the strengths of the implementation is that we can ",(0,s.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"specify")," what our ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"z")," is, and tailor that to our needs. For instance, if we wanted to append a ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'"\\n"')," to our string concatenation, we could use ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'foldr (op^) "\\n"'),". Fold offers us a great deal of flexibility with choosing how we want to reduce a list."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"It is somewhat important to note the type of the function ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"g")," here.

It is useful to think of this ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"'b")," type as the type of the ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"fold"),' function\'s "accumulator", or the information that it stores as it proceeds along its computation.

The polymorphic nature of this accumulator becomes a major strength, as we can "carry along" any kind of information that we like, so long as we define how it changes when we receive a new ',(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"'a"),"-typed element from the list that we are folding."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"So, for instance, the accumulator in ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"foldl (op+) 0")," is simply the sum of all the elements to the left of any given point.

This is a very common idea, where we have some form of data that we would like to put through a series of transformations.
