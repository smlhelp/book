Totality is oftentimes like a sledgehammer, being far more brutish and exhaustive than its use cases necessitate. It is undeniably useful, however. With totality, we do not have to reason about the behavior of a function on any specific inputs - we can just handwave them all and say that no matter what, it must return a valuable output, which is what we really care about. If we revisit the expression ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"(fn x => 15150) (f y)")," with the totality of ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"f")," in hand, now reasoning about it is very simple. We know that ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"y")," is a value, and that ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"f")," is total, so by definition ",(0,s.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"f y")," is valuable.
