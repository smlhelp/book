# Basics

Standard ML is a _functional_ programming language, meaning that we eschew the use of _side effects_ and _state changes_ to obtain programs that are easy to reason about, analogous to reasoning about mathematical expressions. Similarly to mathematics, we perform operations and view computation as a process of _simplification_ (or _reduction_, as we will more commonly name it). Seen in this way, computation becomes an elaborate series of expression evaluations, and it is this concept that will permeate the course. In these notes, we will go further in detail about the basic concepts of SML.
