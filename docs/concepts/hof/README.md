# Higher Order Functions

At this point, we've explored the concept of computation as _evaluation_, passing around values and reducing expressions to values as well. We have seen how we are allowed a great deal of versatility while maintaining type safety in SML's type system, and how we can construct arbitrary datatypes to be passed around as _first class citizens_, that is being able to be manipulated the same as any other value. We will now discuss what is considered one of the most powerful tools available in functional programming languages - that is, the exploitation of _functions themselves_ as values, with which we can further parameterize our functions and results.
