# Recursion and Induction

_By Eunice Chen, June 2020_

## Types

For each of the following expressions, state its type and value.

```sml
fun f (x : int) : int = f x
```

<Hidden>
  Type: <code>int -> int</code> <br />
  Value: the function itself, <code>fn x => &lt;body&gt;</code>
</Hidden>

```sml
val x = []::(150::[])
```

<Hidden>
  Type: not well typed <br />
  Value: no value, it is not well-typed
</Hidden>

```sml
val x = [122]::([150]::[])
```

<Hidden>
  Type: int list list <br />
  Value: <code>[[122], [150]]</code>
</Hidden>

```sml
fun f L =
    case L of
      [] => [[]]
    | x::xs => [x + 1] @ []
```

<Hidden>
  Type: not well-typed <br />
  Value: no value, because it is not well-typed
</Hidden>

What is the type and value of x?

```sml
fun f (y : int) : int = f y
val x : int = f y
```

<Hidden>
  Type: int <br />
  Value: No value, because it loops forever
</Hidden>

What is the type and value of y?

```sml
val x =
    let
      fun incr (n : int) = n + 1
    in
      incr
    end
val y = incr
```

<Hidden>
  Type: No type, since incr is not in scope <br />
  Value: No value, since it is not well typed
</Hidden>

## Induction

Given the following function:

```sml
(* length: int list -> int *)
fun length [] = 0
  | length (x::xs) = 1 + length(xs)

(* append: int list * int list -> int list *)
fun append ([], L) = L
  | append (x::xs, L) = x :: append(xs, L)
```

Prove that for all $L_1, L_2 : \texttt{int list}$,

$$
\texttt{length}(\texttt{append}(L_1, L_2)) = \texttt{length}(L_1) + \texttt{length}(L_2)
$$

Proof: By structural induction on $L_1$.

### Base case

Base case (BC): $L_1 = []$

Proof, from left-hand side (LHS):

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \
  \texttt{length}(\texttt{append}(L_1, L_2))
\\ = & \
  \texttt{length}(\texttt{append}([], L_2))
\\ = & \
  \texttt{length}(L_2) && \text{Clause 1 of \texttt{append}}
\end{aligned}
$$

From right-hand-side (RHS):

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \
  \texttt{length}(L_1) + \texttt{length}(L_2)
\\ = & \
  \texttt{length}([]) + \texttt{length}(L_2)
\\ = & \
  0 + \texttt{length}(L_2) && \text{Clause 1 of \texttt{length}}
\\ = & \
  \texttt{length}(L_2) && \text{math and totality of \texttt{length}}
\end{aligned}
$$

LHS and RHS are both equivalent to identical expressions, and are thus equivalent by transitivity.

### Inductive case

Inductive step (IS): $L_1 = x :: xs$ for some $x : \texttt{int}$, $xs : \texttt{int list}$

Inductive hypothesis (IH):

$$\texttt{length}(\texttt{append} (xs, L_2)) = \texttt{length}(xs) + \texttt{length}(L_2)$$

Want to show (WTS):

$$\texttt{length}(\texttt{append} (x::xs, L_2)) = \texttt{length}(x::xs) + \texttt{length}(L_2)$$

Proof, from LHS:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \
  \texttt{length}(\texttt{append} (L_1, L_2))
\\ = & \
  \texttt{length}(\texttt{append} (x::xs, L_2)
\\ = & \
  \texttt{length} (x::\texttt{append}(xs, L_2)) && \text{Clause 2 of \texttt{append}}
\\ = & \
  1 + \texttt{length}(\texttt{append}(xs, L_2)) && \text{Clause 2 of \texttt{length}, totality of \texttt{append}}
\\ = & \
  1 + \texttt{length}(xs) + \texttt{length}(L_2) && \text{IH}
\end{aligned}
$$

From RHS:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \
  \texttt{length}(L_1) + \texttt{length}(L_2)
\\ = & \
  \texttt{length}(x::xs) + \texttt{length}(L_2)
\\ = & \
  1 + \texttt{length}(xs) + \texttt{length}(L_2) && \text{Clause 2 of \texttt{length}}
\end{aligned}
$$

QED.
