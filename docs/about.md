# About

SML Help is a joint venture between previous and current teaching assistants of the computer science course 15-150: Principles of Functional Programming, taught at Carnegie Mellon University. It is aimed at being a comprehensive and accessible resource to students of 150, as well as those just interested in learning functional programming concepts in general, as viewed through the lens of the Standard ML language.

Teaching assistants form the backbone of 15-150, and SML Help no less. Without them, this page would not have been possible. Special credit goes to Jacob Neumann and Cam Wong for their instrumental work in getting the website working as well as Ariel Davis for their work overhauling the look of the website.

Contributors to SML Help include:

Brandon Wu, Cooper Pierce, David Sun, Eunice Chen, Harrison Grodin, James Gallicchio, Kaz Zhou, Len Huang, and Thea Brick
